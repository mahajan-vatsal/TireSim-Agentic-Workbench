# Prior Runs (Mock)
- 315/80 R22.5 @ 8 bar produced an estimated vertical stiffness near ~250 kN/m (mock baseline).
- Mesh sensitivity:
  - 10 mm target elements → slightly softer curve; 6–8 mm stabilizes the slope estimate.
- Contact stabilization at low load is important; ensure first increments are stable.
- When comparing runs, use identical load_sweep arrays and inflation settings.
