# Vertical Stiffness Notes
- Definition: k = ΔF / Δδ (force vs deflection slope) around the operating region.
- Typical load sweep: 0 → 50 kN in steps of 2–5 kN for truck tires (mock values).
- Inflation pressure strongly impacts stiffness; higher pressure → higher stiffness.
- Use a mesh target element size ~6–10 mm in the tread for steady convergence in static stiffness sweeps.
- Output: a load–deflection curve; compute slope in a central window to avoid seating artifacts.
