# TireSim Agentic Workbench

This project implements a selfâ€‘contained workbench for automating tire finiteâ€‘element simulations with agentic behaviour and retrievalâ€‘augmented generation (RAG). It plans and executes a vertical stiffness sweep, logs every step to a SQLite datastore, retrieves relevant background information from a userâ€‘provided corpus and produces a structured run card summarising the results.

## âœ¨ Features at a glance

1. **Retrievalâ€‘augmented planning** â€“ When a user provides an objective, the agent optionally fetches background material from a local Markdown corpus. The retriever supports keyword, BM25, dense and hybrid methods to provide contextual citations for the simulation. A largeâ€‘language model (LLM) then plans a series of steps to achieve the objective.
2. **Templateâ€‘driven deck generation** â€“ Input decks are defined as Jinja templates. The builtâ€‘in vertical_stiffness.j2 template takes parameters such as tire size, rim, inflation pressure, mesh size and load sweep and produces a deterministic FEM deck. Users can add additional templates for other analyses by dropping new .j2 files into the templates/ folder.
3. **Mock FEM solver** â€“ To keep the demo selfâ€‘contained, a deterministic mock solver generates loadâ€‘deflection curves based on the deck text. It outputs a CSV, a log and a copy of the deck, which are stored as artifacts.
4. **Automated plotting and metrics** â€“ A plotting tool uses Matplotlib to create a PNG of the loadâ€“deflection curve. Postâ€‘processing then computes vertical stiffness (slope) and other metrics. An LLM produces a concise summary with inline citations
5. **Validation and run card generation** â€“ The run_card.py module checks that loads are strictly increasing, deflections are nonâ€‘negative and at least one citation exists. It writes a Run Card summarising the prompt, objective, parameters, citations, metrics, artifacts and validation status in Markdown.
6. **Datastore** â€“ Simulation tasks and runs are logged to a SQLite database. Each run stores its parameters, metrics, artifacts and validation status for later retrieval.

## ðŸŽ¯ Output
The figure below is a typical output from a vertical stiffness sweep. It shows the simulated relationship between vertical load and tyre deflection. The slope of the line (â‰ˆ250 kN/m) corresponds to the estimated vertical stiffness reported in the run card.
